# HANDOVER
## Latest session: 2026-10-17 (Codex / GPT-6)
Done:
- Read the master DOCX including its data and threat tables.
- Created AGENTS.md verbatim, Section 3 UI brief, starter docs, README and names-only .env.example.
- User authorized resolving the conflicting build orders; Section 7 controls (D-002).
- Setup only; no feature code or dependencies installed.
In progress:
- Awaiting approval of the first implementation task.
Broken or risky:
- No application scaffold, package scripts, build or tests exist yet.
- WhatsApp provider and speech/translation provider remain undecided.
- Location OFF privacy, webhook authenticity and voice confirmation require explicit implementation and verification.
Next (exact first step):
- After approval, scaffold Next.js + Tailwind and the prescribed folders; establish design tokens and a local hello page. Propose exact dependency choices before installation.
- Continue Section 7 setup with Firebase; deployment requires separate approval under CONSTRAINTS.md.
Do not touch:
- Secrets, real .env files, production services or live data.
- Preserve the master DOCX and verbatim AGENTS.md/UI brief.
Run / test commands:
- Current: git log --oneline -15; git status; git diff --check.
- Intended after scaffolding: npm install; npm run dev; npm run build; npm test (test runner not chosen).
Unverified assumptions:
- What did I assume that you did not tell me? npm is proposed for future commands; Firebase web configuration variable names are provisional. No runtime or account readiness has been verified.
- Hackathon duration, team size, languages, city, WhatsApp provider and speech provider need clarification before their dependent tasks.
- No screenshot reference is present; the written UI brief is the available design authority.
Read first: ARCHITECTURE.md, CONSTRAINTS.md, UI-DESIGN.md
